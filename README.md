# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

**Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize the workings of various computer science algorithms. With this app, you can explore algorithms related to graph theory, sorting, searching, and more, by observing their step-by-step execution.

The visualizer supports different algorithm types like:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, BFS, DFS)
- Search algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Other classic algorithms (e.g., Dynamic Programming, Greedy algorithms)

## Features _TODO_ 

- Visualize Algorithms: Watch algorithms perform their operations in real-time with visual feedback.

## Technologies Used _TODO ADD MORE_

- React for building the user interface.
